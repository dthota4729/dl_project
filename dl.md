# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation using CNN and U-Net with Explainable AI

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for **automated brain tumor detection and segmentation** from MRI scans. It leverages **EfficientNet** for classification, **U-Net** for segmentation, and **Grad-CAM** for explainable AI to make predictions interpretable for medical professionals.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo and open `model_final_script.ipynb`
2. Set dataset path and run each cell sequentially
3. Trained models can be reused for inference
4. Results (segmentation, heatmaps) are saved in `/outputs` folder
